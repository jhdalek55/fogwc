In this paper we present Seattle, a practical and publicly accessible
\gls{fc} platform with a considerable deployment history.
Seattle's cross-platform portable sandbox implementation tackles
the widely-recognized issue of node heterogeneity.
Its componentized architecture supports a number of
approaches to operating a Seattle-based Fog system,
from isolated, standalone and peer-to-peer operations, to
full-fledged provisioning by a dedicated operator,
or federations of many operators.
Seattle's components and interfaces are
designed for compatibility and reuse, and align with the trust boundaries
that exist between different stakeholders.

Seattle comprises implementations of all components discussed
in this paper. Its free, open-source software stack has been used
for teaching and research; outside groups have used existing Seattle
components, and constructed new components with compatible interfaces
in order to adapt the platform to their needs.
